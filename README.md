Check Understanding Questions: 
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.

   This is because we can get the automated test results and procedurally build our workable software, reducing the cognitive load brought by the manual running of test and testing progress consistently.

2. Yes.
   
   Only because a function is returning the correct output doesn't mean that the software doesn't have any problems from the start to finish. Therefore, E2E testing to test the whole process is still needed.

3. No.

   We would use E2E testing, since it would allows us to emulate user writing messages and sending them. The "message" feature requires multiple user interactions of writing and sending, which cannot be tested using a unit test that is only on one end.

4. Yes.

   We would use unit test, since we are specifically testing encapsulated unit of word length. So Unit Tests fit this perfectly as we can test different input lengths and compare with expected results.
